        <h2> An easy-to-make recipe for a tray of delicious and filling green beans!</h2>
        <h3> (This would go <em>really</em> well with some chicken breasts.)</h3>
        <h4> ((You're going to want to start <strong>this</strong> first if pairing with chicken.))</h4>
        <p> A green bean casserole. I questioned why it existed as a child.</p>
        <p> Now a days, well I can't explain to you exactly why it exists, but I think it's quite yummy.</p>
        <h3> Ingredients </h3>
        <h4>[6 Servings]</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 can (10 1/2 ounces) Campbell's® Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup </li>
            <li>3/4 cup milk </li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon McCormick® Pure Ground Black Pepper</li>
            <li>2 cans (14 1/2 ounces each) any style Del Monte® Green Beans, drained</li>
            <li>1 1/3 cups French's® Original Crispy Fried Onions, divided </li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Steps </h3>
        <ol>

            <li>Bake 30 minutes or until hot. Stir.</li>
            <li>Top with remaining 2/3 cup onions. Bake 5 minutes longer or until onions are golden brown.</li>
            <li> Serve and </br> <strong>Enjoy!</strong></li> <p>(Remember:If using fresh or frozen green beans, make sure to cook them first! Blanch fresh green beans until tender, or steam frozen beans as directed on package.)</p>
