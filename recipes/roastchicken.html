    <h2> A basic recipe for cooking up a bunch of skinless, boneless chicken breasts. </h2>
    <p> This is a relatively quick and easy recipe. Roast chicken is an entree that is easy to pair with basically any side dish.</p>
    <p> Feel free to spice this recipe up with <strong>your</strong> favorite spices! (In place of the <em> Creole seasoning</em>)</p>
    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <h4> [4 Servings]</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of coarse sea salt </li>
        <li>1 pinch Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere'sÂ®), or to taste </li>
        
    </ul>
    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat convection oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle both sides with salt and Creole seasoning. Place chicken in a broiler pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Allow chicken to "rest" at least a few minutes before serving. <strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
    </ol>
