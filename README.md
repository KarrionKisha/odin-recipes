# odin-recipes
The first full project from The Odin Project
PLEASE NOTE: I literally do NOT own any of the content. It is all
borrowed, for practice. I do not intend to make anything off of this.

Welcome to the first "full" HTML website I'll make!
It's going to be ugly, but I'll try to spice it up
with some flavorful recipes! 
UPDATE: I did not do that. I was very lazy with my recipe choices
if we are being honest. I'm not a chef. I never have nor will I
ever claim to be.

I will hopefully complete this efficiently as I have
taken my time learning the HTML basics, the foundations,
which is what will be demonstrated.
UPDATE: Done in one study session. I'd say pretty efficient.
